Week 20 Supervised Learning Challenge



Credit Risk Analysis Report:

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the credit risk of loan applicants by using a logistic regression model. The model is programmed to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on numerous features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt, etc.. By accurately predicting the loan status, our company can make informed decisions to minimize our risk and improve the loan approval processes.

* Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model, which measures the proportion of correct predictions (both healthy and high-risk loans) out of the total predictions made.
* Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. High precision indicates a low false positive rate.
* Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. High recall indicates a low false negative rate.

Summary:

The logistic regression model has a good balance between precision and recall for both healthy and high-risk loans. The accuracy of the model indicates that it can correctly predict the loan status for most of the loan applicants.

Recommendation:

By using this model, the company can enhance its credit risk assessment process, leading to more informed decision-making and reduced financial risk.
